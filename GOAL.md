The goal of this codebase is to create a modern, responsive, and performant personal portfolio website.

The website will showcase my projects, skills, and experience. It will also include an "About Me" section and a contact form.

The project will be built using Astro, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS, following modern web development best practices.
